## Descriptions

#### Problems

We need to find a public API that has return proper data, a library to show google map on the app and a framework that can help me build the good UI

#### Solution

I choose `foursquare`, `google-map-react`, `reactstrap`
<br />
Foursquare: With uncompromising accuracy, accessibility, scale, and respect for consumer data privacy, Foursquare is the location technology platform the world trusts.
<br />
google-map-react: small, simple, and base on Google Maps API. It allows you to render any React component on the Google Map. It is fully isomorphic and can render on a server. Additionally, it can render map components in the browser even if the Google Maps API is not loaded.
<br />
reactstrap: It provides prebuilt Bootstrap 4 components that allow a great deal of flexibility and prebuilt validation. This allows us to quickly build beautiful forms that are guaranteed to impress and provide an intuitive user experience
